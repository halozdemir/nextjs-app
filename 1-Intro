//Were gonna build up this meetup application. The application which were gonna build is all about having some meetups. We got a page that allows us to "create new meetups", and those meetups will then "be sent to some backend" and "will be stored in some database". And then "have a page where we fetch and display a list of meetups". And then we can also "visit the detail page of a given meetup to fetch and to display the details for that specific meetup". And that "would be a dynamic page where different meetup identifiers are encoded into URL". Therefore, were gonna practice "file-base routing", and were gonna add a bunch of new features where NextJS helps us to data fetching but also related to blending back-end and fornt-end code and sending request to an API, which we will build together, in this "nextjs project"
